"Snake" is played by the following rules.</p> <ol><li>The game is played on a $n \times m$ grid. $n$ is the $x$-axis length, and $m$ is the $y$-axis length.</li><li>The player controls the snake in four (Up, Down, Left, Right) directions. The snake is a sequence of&nbsp;an arbitrary number of connected cells&nbsp;$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_l$. Here, "connected" means that for each $1&lt;i \le l$, $c_{i-1}$ and $c_i$ are adjacent side-by-side.</li><li>Each turn, the snake moves either upwards, downwards, left or right. Then, the head ($c_1$) moves towards the direction, and the rest of the cells are superseded by the one previously "in front of it".</li><li>The snake cannot occupy the same cell twice at the same time. Therefore, the head cannot move towards any occupied cell other than its tail ($c_l$).</li><li>The head of the snake cannot move towards the second cell of the snake ($c_2$).</li></ol> <p>This game is very simple and famous, an&nbsp;<strong>ideal strategy</strong> is widely known. The strategy is to keep moving while <strong>preserving the invariant property that the head and tail are adjacent.</strong> hjroh was curious to know how long a snake he can keep alive using the&nbsp;<strong>"ideal strategy"</strong>. Given the dimensions of the grid,&nbsp;$n$ and $m$, output the maximum length of the snake that can be kept alive infinitely using the "<strong>ideal strategy"</strong>.</p></div></section>
