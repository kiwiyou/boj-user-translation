The Incredible Cooks Preparing Cuisine are opening a new restaurant in the International City Promoting Cooking, and they have hired you to find the optimal location for their restaurant.</p> <p>You decide to model the city as a grid, with each grid square having a specified number of people living in it.  The distance between two grid squares $(r_1,c_1)$ and $(r_2,c_2)$ is $|r_1-r_2|+|c_1-c_2|.$ In order to visit the restaurant, each potential customer would incur a cost equal to the minimum distance from the grid square in which they live to the grid square containing the proposed location of the restaurant.  The total cost for a given restaurant location is defined as the sum of the costs of everyone living in the city to visit the restaurant.</p> <p>Given the current city layout, compute the minimum total cost if the Incredible Cooks Preparing Cuisine select their next restaurant location optimally.</p> </div> </section>
