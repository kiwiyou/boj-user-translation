				<p>Lulu has a string consisting of lowercase English letters. She would like to make her string <em>Repetitive</em>. A repetitive string has an even number of characters, and the first half of the string exactly matches the second half of the string. For example, &quot;<strong>lulu</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>abcabc</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>xx</strong>&quot; are repetitive strings, while &quot;<strong>xyx</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>abac</strong>&quot; are not.</p>

<p>To get a repetitive string, Lulu can take two non-overlapping, non-empty substrings from her string and concatenate them together. The substrings must be concatenated in the order that they appear in her string.</p>

<p>She&#39;s wondering, what is the number of ways she can choose two substrings to make a repetitive string? Two ways are different if at least one of the substrings Lulu uses comes from a different part of her string.</p>

<p>Consider the string &quot;<strong>aaaa</strong>&quot;.</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are six ways for Lulu to form the repetitive string &quot;<strong>aa</strong>&quot;: by matching each &quot;<strong>a</strong>&quot; with each subsequent &quot;<strong>a</strong>&quot; ($1$+$2$, $1$+$3$, $1$+$4$, $2$+$3$, $2$+$4$, $3$+$4$).</li>
	<li>There are also three ways for her to form &quot;<strong>aaaa</strong>&quot;: &quot;<strong>a</strong>&quot;+&quot;<strong>aaa</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>aa</strong>&quot;+&quot;<strong>aa</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>aaa</strong>&quot;+&quot;<strong>a</strong>&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>So there are nine ways for Lulu to form a repetitive string by concatenating non-overlapping, non-empty substrings of &quot;<strong>aaaa</strong>&quot; in order.</p>
